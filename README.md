# ffmpeg-pretvornik
Yet another BASH wrapper arpund ffmpeg for batch encodings.
It has a few presets for different formats: web, DVD, Bluray, frames.
And you can apply some generic options: noise removal, border, sharpening, channel muxing.
It will encode all files in chosen folder or it will perform in test mode,
where only small segment of clips is transcoded.

Mac compatible, it works on Bash 3.2
